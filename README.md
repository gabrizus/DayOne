******** 90 DAYS OF PROJECTS : PROJ ONE ********

  The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate my 
ability to adapt to several technologies and create
fully functional applications ( both web-based and 
desktop applications ). 

DAY ONE : 

This app will be a basic web-based application , with 
a backend in Node , and no frontend library or framework.
This app will have CRUD capabilities, and use a PostgreSQL
database. 

The end result ended up being a simple CRUD To-do app, with 
a not so pretty front end , however no use of frontend frameworks 
and a backend of pure express and a connection to a PSQL database
